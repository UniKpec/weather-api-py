# Weather API - Python Tkinter Application

This project is a simple weather application built using Python, Tkinter and Datetime. It fetches real-time weather data (temperature) from the Open-Meteo API and displays it in a graphical user interface (GUI). The default city used in this example is Istanbul, but it can be adapted to other locations by adjusting the latitude and longitude values in the API call.

## Features
- Current Temperature: Displays the temperature for Istanbul (or any other location if changed in the code).
- Current Time: Shows the current date and time.
- API Integration: Fetches real-time weather data using Open-Meteo API.
- User Interface: Simple and clean GUI using Tkinter.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.13
- Tkinter: For creating the GUI.
- Requests: To make HTTP requests and fetch data from the weather API.
- Datetime: To get the current date and time.
